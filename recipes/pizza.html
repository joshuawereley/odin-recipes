        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to
            rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then
            it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Bread Flour</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230
                degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let
                stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until
                smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with
                a dough hook to make it easier.
            </li>
            <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll
                into a 12-inch circle.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
                Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
